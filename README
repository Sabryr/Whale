## Which license can I use to redistribute chatgpt generated code

As an AI language model, ChatGPT generated code is created by OpenAI
and is subject to the OpenAI API Terms of Use. These terms allow for
non-commercial use of the generated content, but commercial use requires
explicit permission from OpenAI.

If you intend to redistribute ChatGPT generated code for commercial purposes,
you should contact OpenAI to obtain permission and clarify any licensing terms.
For non-commercial use, you can attribute the code to OpenAI and include a link
to the OpenAI API Terms of Use. You may also want to consider using a permissive
open-source license, such as the MIT or Apache license, to make it clear that the 
code is available for others to use, modify, and redistribute without restriction.
However, it's important to note that the license only applies to code that you 
have written, not to the code generated by ChatGPT.
